  <description>
    This WebScript is based on the hybrid-page that's ootb. We duplicate the whole path of the hdp page type to arrive here
    in order to clean up the ugly url. It wasn't necessary to duplicate the whole path, but just in case we need to seperate
    certain logic for future development and also as our knowledge of surf gets better and the new UI framework improves we
    may end up cleaning this up for something much better.
